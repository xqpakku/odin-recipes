        Description
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Chicken may sometimes have a terrible reputation for drying out in the oven, but we won't let that happen here. 
            With chicken thighs you don't need to worry—even if they're skinless and boneless. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our secret? These boneless chicken thighs first get marinated in an easy honey mustard-esque sauce that makes them so incredibly juicy and flavorful.
            Baking the thighs at a high temp means less time spent in the oven with even better results. 
            These thighs are great served with a big salad or some roasted potatoes.
